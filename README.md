# Project Description

### Qualifying Students
This project is for any students missing 
* full CRUD 
* a join statement
* or for those who cannot explain the above to a satisfactory level 
When grading, be sure to require an explanation of these concepts, especially for students who recieved a lot of mentor help during personals. 

### Project Duration 
The students will have three days to complete this project. Typically this project will be done Tue-Thur of the Angular week. The code reviews should be done Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. 

### Mentor Involvement
The students should receive very little help during this project. If they have a weird bug, feel free to jump in and help, but any typical debugging should be done by the student alone and any conceptual questions should not be answered until after the project has been passed off.
The students should be discouraged from seeking help from other students or developer friends as well. If they fake their way through this project we can't help them get their skills where they need to be and they will graduate without being ready for a job. 

### Code Review
A code review should be performed for each student at the end of the project. This has two main parts: a demo of the functionality in the browser (to make sure the code compiles correctly), and a walkthrough of the code itself with the student explaining each line. 
The walkthrough should focus on CRUD, the join statement, and basic React component lifecycle (ex. "Once the response comes back from the server, I set state with the data and the page rerenders"). The student doesn't need to explain routing, JSX, or CSS unless you feel they are struggling a lot with those concepts. 
Students have occasionally used code written by other people to pass this project, despite our warnings about cheating themselves. If you notice advanced patterns or a unexpected level of competency in code, make sure to push the student to explain the code very thoroughly. 
The mentor from Async should sit in on these code reviews if possible, and will have experience with performing code reviews.
